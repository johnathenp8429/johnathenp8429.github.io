My Program:
```
(deine size(put-image( star 30"solid" "white")
          320 175
          (put-image(circle 75 "solid" "dark green")\
                    315 175
                    (put-image(circle 75 "solid" "white")
                              300 160
                              (put-image( rectangle 125 500 "solid" "white") 
                                        50 55 
                                        (rectangle 500 300 "solid" "dark green")))))  
                                        
```
![flag image](/image/flag.png)

what I did to create this flag is go on wescheme and started to put in the program. I started with a solid white circle and i had to put in the x cordinates and the y cordinates to place the white circle in the center. And then did the dark green circel to creat the cresent of the moon on the flag. I had a little hard time trying to place it in the right spot to creat the cresent of the flag but I got it after a few tries. Next I did a white rectangle to creat the white side of the fald. Then the dark green rectangle was next that i feel like was the easist one because I just had to put it in with a bigger size. And the star was next this hard I had to put it in the right place and put in the right cordinates, bu after a while i got it.
