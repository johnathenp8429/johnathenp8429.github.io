In my class we are learning about what the computer knows and what it doesnt know. we put in random math equations, also that math and coding are kinda the same thing. I dont think i find anything challenging at the moment in class but im sure once Mr.Allatta sees my post he will find me something to make challening for me. Hey Mr.Allatta.
