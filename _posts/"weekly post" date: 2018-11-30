so we tool a test in class a midterm. and we have to post about a question I chose question 2. the question was whqat is name
of the most outer function in (scale 2(circle 40 "solid" "blue"). the correct answer is a. becasue outer most funcion is 
inside of the (). most people chose b. circle, that's because circle is a function just that they were looking in the wrong
place.
